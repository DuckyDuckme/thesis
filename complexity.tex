Security of lattice-based cryptography: Discussing the security of lattice-based cryptography against quantum computers, including the hardness of the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) and the Closest Vector Problem (CVP), which are believed to be hard problems for quantum computers. (NP-hard but no proof yet) \\
