\subsection{Fully Homomorphic Encryption Using Ideal Lattices}
three ``generations'' of fhe schemes, first original gentry, smart and
explain here how we can construct a really nice homomorphic encryption scheme using ideal lattices \cite{gentry}. present the 
\subsubsection*{On Ideal Lattices and Learning With Errors Over Rings}
this is somewhat too difficult for me i think so ill just present main findings without proofs and details \cite{regev}, \\
First explain what lattices are. \\
How do lattices relate to LWE? The secret key is associated with a random vector. \\
then show how ring-lwe satisfies both of our requirements \cite{ring-lwe}, namely, the believed hardness for quantum computers (SVP or approximate SVP) and FHE. Show also the problem with ring-LWE because the lattices that are used there are ideal lattices which obviously possess more structure than "normal" lattices.
