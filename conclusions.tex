a quote from \cite{intro_cryp}: "In real world scenarios, cryptosystems based on N P-hard or N P-complete problems tend to rely on a particular subclass of problems, either to achieve efficiency or to allow the creation of a trapdoor. When this is done, there is always the possibility that some special property of the chosen subclass of problems makes them easier to solve than the general case"
