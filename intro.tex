\subsection{Actual introduction here with some funny name}
\subsection{Motivation}
include the table from page 16 of \cite{bernstein} of systems broken by quantum computers\\
quote from \cite{bernstein}: ``As it turns out, number theoretic problems are also the main place where quantum computers have been shown to have exponential speedups. Examples of such problems include factoring and discrete log [38], Pellâ€™s equation [18], and computing the unit group and class group of a number field [17, 37]. The existence of these algorithms implies that a quantum computer could break RSA, Diffie-Hellman and ellipti curve cryptography, which are currently used''
\subsection{Main results}
I imagine this will be filled last.
