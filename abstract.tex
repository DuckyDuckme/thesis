In 2009 Craig Gentry presented in his PhD thesis the first fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) using ideal lattices. Since then countless new works have been created implementing his ideas of  ``bootstrapping'' and ``squashing'' to obtain even more efficient homomorphic schemes. In this bachelor thesis we present what the FHE actually is and how we can achieve efficient implementations using two examples -- LWE and ring-LWE lattice-based schemes. To do that, we first present the actual hardness proofs for both of them and then proceed to FHE implementations.
